    <article><div><h1>Windows Updates</h1><p><a href="/potential-computing-machine/Notes">< Back</a></p><p>This is specifically to run windows updates from the terminal.</p><h2>Using PowerShell</h2><p>There are a few steps to take in order to run updates from the terminal.</p><ul><li>Set Execution Policy to Bypass</li><li>Install Module PSWindowsUpdate</li><li>Run PSWindowsUpdate</li><li>Schedule Reboot if needed</li><li>Troubleshoot as needed</li></ul><h3>Execution Policy</h3><p>The execution policy is a security feature that is meant to stop threat actors from running malicious scripts. We are going to need to bypass the default policy, <b>Restricted</b> in order work on the computer.</p><p>You can check the current policy by:</p><pre><code>Get-ExecutionPolicy
</code></pre><p>We are going to change it by:</p><pre><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
</code></pre><h3>Install Module PSWindowsUpdate</h3><p>Run the following to start the install process. If this is your first time running an install command on a computer, you may be prompted to update NuGet and whether you trust the PSGallery. Type Y for both and press enter.</p><pre><code>Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate
</code></pre><p>If you get a message stating that an older version of PSWindowsUpdate is already installed, you can update the module by running the following.</p><pre><code>Update-Module PSWindowsUdpate
</code></pre><h3>Run PSWindows Update</h3><p>This is where we may start to encounter some issues that will require some troubleshooting.</p><p>To start run:</p><pre><code>Get-WindowsUpdate -AcceptAll -Install
</code></pre><p>The line above will get all pending available updates, accept the download and start the install process. You can also add the -AutoReboot flag if you know the computer is not being worked on. If all goes well, that is pretty much the end of it. Just schedule a reboot if needed.</p><h3>Schedule Reboot</h3><p>This can be handled a couple of ways but the easisest is from our scipts in ConnectWise. Right click the computer in question, navigate to Scripts > Actions > *Schedule Reboot. That will schedule a reboot to run at midnight and you can view it from Task Scheduler on the computer.</p><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>There are a lot of things that could go wrong but here are some of the more general steps that you can take that have worked for me.</p><p>If you've entered the PSWindowsUpdate command but nothing is happening, first try pressing Enter. If nothing changes, we're going to have to open the Windows Update Troubleshooter.</p><p>From the terminal run: <code> msdt.exe /id WindowsUpdateDiagnostic </code></p><p>This will open up a new window. From there run the troubleshooter and try again.</p><p>Some error logs that have helped in the past are located in C:\Windows\Panther. Also looking up the KB number for a patch that fails to install has proved useful in the past.</p></div></article>
